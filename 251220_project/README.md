### TIMER PRACTICE

I have noticed that writing pure Vanilla JS makes me understand React way much better than I thought.

### This is a nice practice of SetInterval Method, which should always require some TimerId's because 'onclick' event keeps calling ID a lot of times.

### Good 10-20 minute practice for a day.
