## Seat Reservation System 
A lightweight interactive seat booking interface built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.
This shows DOM manipulation, event handling and asynchronous state management.

### Features
* Dynamic seat generation (using forEach method)
* Asynchronous booking : simulates a server request with 3000 ms delay using ```setTimeout``` when selecting a seat.
* UI Feedback : displays a "loading..." during the booking process, disables the button for double clicks, toggles visual states
* Live statistics : tracking the total number of reserved seats. 
* Global reset : a "clear all" function that resets the room states, counter and list simultaneously.
