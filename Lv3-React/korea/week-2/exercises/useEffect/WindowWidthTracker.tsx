/**
 * Goal: Track and display the current window width.
 * Task:
 * - Create a 'width' state initialized with window.innerWidth.
 * - Add a 'resize' event listener to the window object that updates the state.
 * - Render the current width inside the component.
 * Constraints:
 * - The event listener must be added only once when the component mounts.
 * - You MUST remove the event listener (cleanup) when the component unmounts to prevent memory leaks.
