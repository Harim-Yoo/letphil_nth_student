/**
 * Goal: Disable page scrolling when a modal overlay is active.
 * Task:
 * - Create an 'isOpen' boolean state to toggle a "modal" view.
 * - When 'isOpen' is true, set document.body.style.overflow to "hidden".
 * - When 'isOpen' is false, set it back to "unset" or "auto".
 * Constraints:
 * - You must provide a cleanup function to ensure the scroll is re-enabled if the component unmounts while the modal is open.
