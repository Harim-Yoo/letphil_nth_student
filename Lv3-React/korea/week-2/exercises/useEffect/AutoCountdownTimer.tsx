/**
 * Goal: Build a countdown timer that starts from 10.
 * Task:
 * - Create a 'seconds' state starting at 10.
 * - Use setInterval to decrease the value by 1 every second.
 * - Stop the timer when it reaches 0.
 * Constraints:
 * - Ensure the interval is cleared (clearInterval) when the component unmounts.
 * - Avoid "stale closures" by ensuring the effect correctly accesses the latest state or uses a functional update.
