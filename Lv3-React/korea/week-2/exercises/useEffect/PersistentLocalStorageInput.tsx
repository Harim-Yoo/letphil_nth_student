/**
 * Goal: Keep an input field's value in sync with the browser's LocalStorage.
 * Task:
 * - Create a 'text' state for a text input.
 * - Whenever 'text' changes, save the value to LocalStorage under the key "user-input".
 * - (Stretch) On initial mount, check if a value exists in LocalStorage and set it as the initial state.
 * Constraints:
 * - The saving logic should reside inside a useEffect that depends on the 'text' state.
