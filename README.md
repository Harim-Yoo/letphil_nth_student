# Open Repository to document what I have learned and coded in hard ways.
In the age of AI, one can easily code anything (not sure whether this is an accurate statement.).

Inspired by LetPhil, ThePrimeagen, I began coding in my late 30's (which is basically year 2025), and I think this is the best decision I have ever made in my late 30's. 

I truly believe in "Every line of code is liability," and I don't buy the idea that the vibe-coding replaces all. In fact, I spent more than 8 months of vibe-coding, learning nothing about coding and learning nothing about maintenance. I decided that I should ship the product on my own, building the MOAT myself. 

I am not looking for cool jobs, I just want to dive deep into one language and understand thoroughly. I am here to follow the five steps suggested by Primeagen. 

#1. Learn the Syntax.
#2. Look up the Documentation.
#3. Get Used to the Writing.
#4. WebSocket Chat Client (more than HTTP).
#5. Dive deep into a multiple projects.


## I am a student at LetPhil, and will become versatile in web dev, in front-end or back-end.
### Front-end : HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT

### Back-end : Node.js (or probably Python)
