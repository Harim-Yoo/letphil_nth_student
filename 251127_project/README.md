# Project : Making a snippet from scratch
 
## Yesterday, I made a mini-project called "Lapis Clamat" and I had to resort to Gemini to ask for making a snippet. Though I understood the logic and follow through, it ain't mine. Thus begins the project "make-a-snippet."

## Make a html file (index.html).
## Make a CSS file (styles.css) (There is a frog part I have here, too)
## Make a place where I can paste the copied part (This is the frog part.)
## Instead of making an external file, make a script code inside html file to make it happen.

### Identifying the frog.
### 1. How do I make a place that I can copy it? (I got some options that I thought. Shall I simply use appendChild method?)
### 2. How do I change the div into a nicer form such that the text looks nice? (I don't think this is frog, but I haven't tried yet.)
